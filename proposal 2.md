# Final Project Proposal

## Your Opinions

The app gives the user a single opinion card. And the user can choose to agree with this opinion or disagree with it. After the user made his or her decision. The card will show how many people that using this app chose the same answer and then give the user another opinion card. Users can also create their own opinion card and let other users provide them with the feedback on it. For example, a user is considering buying a new iPhone, so he or she can post an opinion like “Is it worth buying the new iPhone that just released?” Later on, the user can see the support rate in his account.

We are using Vue for the front end and firebase for the backend database. Since we only have two people and the Vue with Firebase need time to learn, for the A4, we made the prototype of this app so that users can vote on our pre-made opinions that severed on Firebase . But in the final project, we can have the users have their account and a smoother experience.

## Stacks used

- VueJs (front-end framework)
- Firebase (back-end database)
- Bootstrap (Layout)
